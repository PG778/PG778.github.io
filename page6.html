  <p> In this lab we learned about the types of markets, horizontal and vertical. This lab overall was pretty simple but was definitely overthought. All this lab helped me succeed and allowed me to understand what I needed to do which was very nice. This lab allowed me to also study to help me pass a test which was nice. <br><br> When doing this lab I struggled at first but got the hang of it. The purpose of the lab is to see if you know the difference between horizontal and vertical markets so that we know when we go into the industry. It taught us the importance of knowing the differences so that we do know what markets are targeted for certain products.<br><br>This lab was very much easy, and it was nice being able to learn some stuff that I needed no matter what. Because of this lab, I did a lot better on the test than I thought I would if I hadn't done this lab at all. In all, I think this lab was very needed and useful.</p>
