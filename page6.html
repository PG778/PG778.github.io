  <p id="AboutMe"> In this lab we learned about the types of markets, horizontal and vertical. This lab overall was pretty simple but was definitely overthought. All this lab helped me succeed and allowed me to understand what I needed to do which was very nice. This lab allowed me to also study to help me pass a test which was nice. <br><br> When doing this lab I struggled at first but got the hang of it. The purpose of the lab is to see if you know the difference between horizontal and vertical markets so that we know when we go into the industry. It taught us the importance of knowing the differences so that we do know what markets are targeted for certain products.<br><br>This lab was very much easy, and it was nice being able to learn some stuff that I needed no matter what. Because of this lab, I did a lot better on the test than I thought I would if I hadn't done this lab at all. In all, I think this lab was very needed and useful.</p>

  <p id = "AboutMe">For this project we as a class were given the independence to make our own rendition of a board game but in unity. Me and Chace Moniz decided to do something simple and created connect 4. The first thing we did was start gathering assets for the project like the spots for the board and the pieces. After gathering the assets I started the first part of getting the pieces to place and hover over the board where the user wants to place them.
<br><br> 	After I did that part Chace took over to make the win checks, an equally as difficult task. He first had to write the loops so that they did not extend over the size of the board. After that he made a function to get the piece script at the area and made it so that if the area is null it won’t run on it and error. The biggest challenge of this was working with another person on something other than a website for the first time.
<br<br> This project was key for teaching me how to work together with others on coding.
<br<br> Connect 4 also taught me how to work with many different classes simultaneously. Another thing I learned was how to work with unity to upload my project to my partner’s computer so that they could work on it with me. Lastly we learned how important it is to communicate with each other during a coding project like this, because when we didn’t we failed to work together as a group.</p>
