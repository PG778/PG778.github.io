    <p>In the following image a website will be seen that was created our freshman year here at OC. The main idea and focus of this project was to make a website that will showcase a overly <br> basic layout for a resturant website. I was able to get it simple, but looking back, god the color scheme is bad but I was able to get the website made <br> and also had an image and some links in there that show some of Corps (In this case the shcool website) which at the time was advanced for us..</p>

  <p id = "AboutMe"> Now the snippet of code that is seen is actually pretty cool. In the method Display, i used a loop to lood through anything in an arraylist and display it. In this case it would display the crossword puzzle board to the exact og what is in the arraylist. The above method Crossword takes in 3 things, the number of rows, number of columns, and the narraylist of the clues. The board is tested to make sure that it contains enough squares to place and correctly fill up the board. Below that the loop goes through and checks to see if a work is verticle or horizontal and then displaying it accordingly. <br></p>

      <p id = "AboutMe"> The project that is seen below is a video of a game that I have been working on in my senior year of shop. It is a game that is very well known and it is PacMan. Although it seems incomplete it is very close to being done. I have leanred from this project that PacMan is indeed not an easy game to make, every ghost has its own path and pattern to follow along with rules in which it can follow the player. The game has taught me that even the most simple things can turn into something that is rather advanced and complicated to make. Overall I am proud of this game and I look forward to completing it in free time and time to come.</p>
