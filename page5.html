    <p>In the following image a website will be seen that was created our freshman year here at OC. The main idea and focus of this project was to make a website that will showcase a overly <br> basic layout for a resturant website. I was able to get it simple, but looking back, god the color scheme is bad but I was able to get the website made <br> and also had an image and some links in there that show some of Corps (In this case the shcool website) which at the time was advanced for us..</p>

  <p id = "AboutMe">In the seen above images you will see something that is called Block Coding. Block Coding is something that I had the pleasure of doing in my Sophmore Year of Highschool. The image on the left is an app that I made to recreate a GPS type app, in this app you can pin a location you want to travel to and also add pins for points of interest. This app allowed me to learn about embedding a map into a app and allow a user to explore the world based off of named locations and even coordinates for a location. <br><br> 
    On the right side youll see another image from another project that I had done in my Sophmore year. This app was a game based on the armed forces. The purpose of this game was to answer a question that was given to a user for points, if a player gets one wrong their score gets reset to the start and so on. I was able to learn how to have user based interactions in a game and how to get those user interactions to work within the app/game also.</p>

  <p id = "AboutMe"> Now the snippet of code that is seen is actually pretty cool. In the method Display, i used a loop to lood through anything in an arraylist and display it. In this case it would display the crossword puzzle board to the exact og what is in the arraylist. The above method Crossword takes in 3 things, the number of rows, number of columns, and the narraylist of the clues. The board is tested to make sure that it contains enough squares to place and correctly fill up the board. Below that the loop goes through and checks to see if a work is verticle or horizontal and then displaying it accordingly. <br></p>

  I think that my favorite site is a tasty website (Thus Far). My reasoning behind this is that this project made me SO UNBELIEVABLY HUNGRY IT WAS CRAZY. I do rather enjoy being hungry at moments, but not when lunchtime is over 1-2 HOURS A DAY.  But it was a fun and interesting project. It was fun because I really enjoy web design more than I enjoy anything else, simply because I understand more than anything else.<br>

The best thing about that website is the fact that when stuff comes easy to me like the project did come easy to me it was fun for me, I am one who does NOT like to struggle. I think that the tasty websites were fun because I absolutely love eating and I love food with a passion. The photo booth was kinda fun but it was definitely not my fav, I rather like typing more than anything here. On the tasty website, I learned how to better use tables and media options and all that fun stuff. I rather enjoy doing CSS because it is somewhat easy for me,

      <p id = "AboutMe"> The project that is seen below is a video of a game that I have been working on in my senior year of shop. It is a game that is very well known and it is PacMan. Although it seems incomplete it is very close to being done. I have leanred from this project that PacMan is indeed not an easy game to make, every ghost has its own path and pattern to follow along with rules in which it can follow the player. The game has taught me that even the most simple things can turn into something that is rather advanced and complicated to make. Overall I am proud of this game and I look forward to completing it in free time and time to come.</p>
