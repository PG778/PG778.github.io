  <p>In the seen above images you will see something that is called Block Coding. Block Coding is something that I had the pleasure of doing in my Sophmore Year of Highschool. The image on the left is an app that I made to recreate a GPS type app, in this app you can pin a location you want to travel to and also add pins for points of interest. This app allowed me to learn about embedding a map into a app and allow a user to explore the world based off of named locations and even coordinates for a location. <br><br> 
  On the right side youll see another image from another project that I had done in my Sophmore year. This app was a game based on the armed forces. The purpose of this game was to answer a question that was given to a user for points, if a player gets one wrong their score gets reset to the start and so on. I was able to learn how to have user based interactions in a game and how to get those user interactions to work within the app/game also.</p>

  <p> Now the snippet of code that is seen above is actually pretty cool. In the method Display, i used a loop to lood through anything in an arraylist and display it. In this case it would display the crossword puzzle board to the exact og what is in the arraylist. The above method Crossword takes in 3 things, the number of rows, number of columns, and the narraylist of the clues. The board is tested to make sure that it contains enough squares to place and correctly fill up the board. Below that the loop goes through and checks to see if a work is verticle or horizontal and then displaying it accordingly. </p>

      <p> The project that is seen below is a video of a game that I have been working on in my senior year of shop. It is a game that is very well known and it is PacMan. Although it seems incomplete it is very close to being done. I have leanred from this project that PacMan is indeed not an easy game to make, every ghost has its own path and pattern to follow along with rules in which it can follow the player. The game has taught me that even the most simple things can turn into something that is rather advanced and complicated to make. Overall I am proud of this game and I look forward to completing it in free time and time to come.</p>
